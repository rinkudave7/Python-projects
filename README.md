1. Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis aims to provide insights into how profitable the food delivery service is on a per-order basis.
Below is the process I will follow for the task of Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis:
- Start by gathering comprehensive data related to all aspects of food delivery operations.
- Clean the dataset for inconsistencies, missing values, or irrelevant information.
- Extract relevant features that could impact cost and profitability.
- Break down the costs associated with each order, including fixed costs (like packaging) and variable costs (like delivery fees and discounts).
- Determine the revenue generated from each order, focusing on commission fees and the order value before discounts.
- For each order, calculate the profit by subtracting the total costs from the revenue. Analyze the distribution of profitability across all orders to identify trends.
- Based on the cost and profitability analysis, develop strategic recommendations aimed at enhancing profitability.
- Use the data to simulate the financial impact of proposed changes, such as adjusting discount or commission rates.
