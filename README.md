1. **Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis** aims to provide insights into how profitable the food delivery service is on a per-order basis.
Below is the process I will follow for the task of Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis:
- Start by gathering comprehensive data related to all aspects of food delivery operations.
- Clean the dataset for inconsistencies, missing values, or irrelevant information.
- Extract relevant features that could impact cost and profitability.
- Break down the costs associated with each order, including fixed costs (like packaging) and variable costs (like delivery fees and discounts).
- Determine the revenue generated from each order, focusing on commission fees and the order value before discounts.
- For each order, calculate the profit by subtracting the total costs from the revenue. Analyze the distribution of profitability across all orders to identify trends.
- Based on the cost and profitability analysis, develop strategic recommendations aimed at enhancing profitability.
- Use the data to simulate the financial impact of proposed changes, such as adjusting discount or commission rates.

- Based on the analysis, here are the overall metrics for the food delivery operations:
  'Total Orders': 1000, 'Total Revenue': 126990, 'Total Costs': 161041.85, 'Total Profit': -34051.85

**A New Strategy for Profits**: 
From the analysis so far we understood that the discounts on food orders are resulting in huge losses. Now, we need to find a new strategy for profitability. We need to find a sweet spot for offering discounts and charging commissions. To find a sweet spot for commission and discount percentages, we can analyze the characteristics of profitable orders more deeply. Specifically, we need to look for:
- A new average commission percentage based on profitable orders.
- A new average discount percentage for profitable orders, that could serve as a guideline for what level of discount still allows for profitability.

**From the analysis**:
New Average Commission Percentage: 28.72%
New Average Discount Percentage: 5.55%
